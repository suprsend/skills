# iOS Push Content Schema

For variants with `channel: "iospush"`.

**Schema URL:** `https://schema.suprsend.com/template/v2/channel/iospush_schema.json`

## Fields

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $schema | string | No |  |
| templating_language | string | No |  |
| header | string | Yes | message title/header |
| body | string | Yes | message text/body |
| image_url | string | No | image url |
| action_url | string | No | action url/deeplink |
| badge | integer | No | badge count |
| sound | string | No |  |
| content_available | integer | No |  |
| mutable_content | integer | No |  |
| thread_identifier | string | No |  |
| notification_type | string | No |  |
| via_suprsend | boolean | No |  |

`header` and `body` are required. All other fields are optional.

- `content_available: 1` enables background app refresh (silent push).
- `mutable_content: 1` allows a Notification Service Extension to modify the payload before display (used for media attachments).
- `via_suprsend: true` routes delivery telemetry back through SuprSend.

## Examples

### Simple notification

```json
{
  "header": "New message",
  "body": "{{ sender.name }}: {{ message.preview }}",
  "badge": 1,
  "sound": "default"
}
```

### Rich notification with image attachment

```json
{
  "header": "Order shipped",
  "body": "Your order #{{ order.id }} is on its way",
  "image_url": "{{ order.cover_image }}",
  "action_url": "acme://orders/{{ order.id }}",
  "badge": 1,
  "mutable_content": 1,
  "thread_identifier": "orders"
}
```

# iOS Push

> Design iOS Push notification templates with title, body, image, and action URL — with a live lock screen preview.

The iOS Push editor is a form with title, body, image, and action URL — with a live lock screen preview on the right. Content is personalised with [Handlebars](/docs/handlebars-helpers) variables (`{{variable_name}}`).


## iOS Push fields

**Title** — single-line heading. Keep under 30 characters — iOS truncates on the lock screen. Supports Handlebars variables.

**Body** — multi-line message text. Front-load key info in the first line (4 lines visible in expanded view). Supports Handlebars variables.

**Image URL** — *optional.* Public URL for a rich notification image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, min 1024x1024 for best rendering). GIFs play in the expanded view. Requires a Notification Service Extension in your app — the SuprSend iOS SDK includes this by default. See [iOS SDK integration](/docs/ios-integration).

**Action URL** — *optional.* URL opened on tap. Always set one — without it, tapping opens the app's default screen. Supports deep links and Handlebars variables.

## Adding dynamic content

You can add variables in the template to personalise it for each recipient. Variables are replaced with actual data at send time.


  **Add variables in the Variables panel**
    Add sample data in the **Variables panel** (Input Payload section) on the left side of the editor. This powers auto-suggestions and the live preview. For the full guide, see [Adding dynamic content](/docs/templates#the-variables-panel).
  

  **Use variables in the template**
    Type `{{` in any field — matching variables appear as auto-suggestions. You can also type variable names manually following [Handlebars syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars).

    **Examples using this sample data:**

    
      ```json json theme={"system"}
      {
        "event": {
          "location": {
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "state": "California"
          },
          "order_id": "11200123",
          "first_name": "Joe"
        },
        "product_image_url": "https://yourapp.com/images/product.jpg"
      }
      ```
    

    * **Nested variable:** `{{event.location.city}}` → renders as `San Francisco`
    * **Variable with space in name:** `{{event.[first name]}}`

    The preview section shows sample values rendered in real-time. If a variable isn't rendering, check:

    1. The variable is defined in the Variables panel.
    2. The variable name matches the Handlebars syntax exactly.
  


> **Warning:**
  If a variable cannot be rendered at send time (missing or mismatched data), SuprSend discards the iOS Push notification for that user. Other channels in the same template group are still sent.


## Preview and test

The right panel shows a live iOS lock screen preview, updated in real time as you edit. Variables render using data from the **Variables panel**.

Click **Test** in the top-right corner to send a real push notification to a real device. This uses the **live version** — commit your changes before testing. See [Testing a Template](/docs/templates#test) for the full guide.

## Commit

Click **Commit** in the top bar to publish the current draft as a new live version. Add an optional description for versioning.

## Frequently asked questions


  ### Why aren't images showing in my push notification?
    Your app needs a **Notification Service Extension** to display rich media (images, GIFs). The SuprSend iOS SDK includes this by default. If you're not using the SDK, add the extension manually. Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF. Max size: 10 MB. Images display in the expanded notification view (long-press or swipe down). See [iOS SDK integration](/docs/ios-integration).
  

  ### How do deep links work in iOS push?
    The **Action URL** supports three URL types:

    | URL type       | Format                                                | Behaviour                                                                                                           |
    | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Web URL        | `https://yourapp.com/orders/123`                      | Opens in Safari (or your app if [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) are configured) |
    | Custom scheme  | `yourapp://orders/123`                                | Opens the matching view controller in your app                                                                      |
    | Universal Link | `https://yourapp.com/orders/123` (Associated Domains) | Opens your app directly                                                                                             |

    Prefer Universal Links — they work as both web fallback and in-app deep links.
  

  ### How does badge count work?
    SuprSend increments the app badge by 1 for each notification. Clear the badge in your app when the user opens it or reads notifications.
  

  ### What happens if a variable is missing at send time?
    SuprSend discards the iOS Push notification for that user. Other channels in the same template group are still sent if they render successfully.
