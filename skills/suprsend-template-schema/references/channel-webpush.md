# Web Push

> Design Web Push notification templates with title, body, image, action URL, and buttons — with a live Windows/macOS preview.

The Web Push editor is a form with title, body, image, action URL, and buttons — with a live preview on the right (toggle between Windows and macOS). Content is personalised with [Handlebars](/docs/handlebars-helpers) variables (`{{variable_name}}`).


## Web Push fields

**Title** — single-line heading. Keep under 40 characters (Windows truncates aggressively; macOS is more generous). Supports Handlebars variables.

**Large Icon** — shown to the right of the notification text. Defaults to your organisation logo (set in Organisation Settings). Cannot be changed per template.

**Body** — 2-3 lines max. One sentence with a clear CTA is ideal. Supports Handlebars variables.

**Banner Image URL** — *optional.* 2:1 aspect ratio (recommended 720x480), under 200 KB for instant rendering. Formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG.

**Action URL** — URL opened on notification click. Always include one — without it, clicking does nothing. Supports Handlebars variables.

**Chrome Action Buttons** — *optional.* Up to 2 buttons with action-oriented labels (2-3 words: "View Order", "Shop Now"). Supports Handlebars. Only visible on Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) — on Firefox and Safari, only the title, body, and click action are shown.

## Adding dynamic content

You can add variables in the template to personalise it for each recipient. Variables are replaced with actual data at send time.


  **Add variables in the Variables panel**
    Add sample data in the **Variables panel** (Input Payload section) on the left side of the editor. This powers auto-suggestions and the live preview. For the full guide, see [Adding dynamic content](/docs/templates#the-variables-panel).
  

  **Use variables in the template**
    Type `{{` in any field — matching variables appear as auto-suggestions. You can also type variable names manually following [Handlebars syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars).

    **Examples using this sample data:**

    
      ```json json theme={"system"}
      {
        "event": {
          "order_id": "11200123",
          "first_name": "Nikita"
        },
        "product_name": "RayBan Sunglasses",
        "product_image_url": "https://yourapp.com/images/product.jpg"
      }
      ```
    

    * **Nested variable:** `{{event.order_id}}` → renders as `11200123`
    * **Variable with space in name:** `{{event.[first name]}}`

    The preview section shows sample values rendered in real-time. If a variable isn't rendering, check:

    1. The variable is defined in the Variables panel.
    2. The variable name matches the Handlebars syntax exactly.
  


> **Warning:**
  If a variable cannot be rendered at send time (missing or mismatched data), SuprSend discards the Web Push notification for that user. Other channels in the same template group are still sent.


## Preview and test

The right panel shows a live notification preview (toggle Windows / macOS). Variables render using data from the **Variables panel**.

Click **Test** in the top-right corner to send a real web push to a real browser. This uses the **live version** — commit your changes before testing. See [Testing a Template](/docs/templates#test) for the full guide.

## Commit

Click **Commit** in the top bar to publish the current draft as a new live version. Add an optional description for versioning.

## Frequently asked questions


  ### Which browsers support which features?
    | Feature        | Chrome        | Firefox | Safari (macOS) | Edge          |
    | -------------- | ------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
    | Title + Body   | Yes           | Yes     | Yes            | Yes           |
    | Banner Image   | Yes           | Yes     | No             | Yes           |
    | Action Buttons | Yes (up to 2) | No      | No             | Yes (up to 2) |
    | Large Icon     | Yes           | Yes     | No             | Yes           |

    Action buttons are labelled "Chrome Action Buttons" in the editor because they only render on Chromium browsers. Design your notification so the core message is in the title + body, with buttons as an enhancement.
  

  ### How do I change the large icon?
    The large icon defaults to your organisation logo set in **Organisation Settings** on the SuprSend dashboard. It cannot be changed per template — update it in your org settings if you need a different icon.
  

  ### How often should I send web push notifications?
    Web push has higher opt-out rates than other channels. Send only high-value, time-sensitive notifications to maintain subscriber trust. Over-sending is the fastest way to lose subscribers.
  

  ### What happens if a variable is missing at send time?
    SuprSend discards the Web Push notification for that user. Other channels in the same template group are still sent if they render successfully.
