SuprSend templates define the content of a notification — the subject and body of an email, the text of an SMS, the layout of an in-app inbox message, and so on. Templates are channel-aware and locale-aware.

Internally, every template is modeled as a collection of **variants**. A variant pairs a channel, locale, optional tenant, and optional condition with channel-specific content. Enabling a channel auto-creates its reserved **`default`** variant (`id: "default"`, `locale: "en"`, `tenant_id: null`, no conditions) — a simple template is just that one variant with its content filled in. Adding more locales, more tenants, or conditional content means adding more variants under the same template.

Each variant validates against `https://schema.suprsend.com/template/v2/variant_schema.json`. The `content` object inside a variant validates against a channel-specific schema selected by the `channel` field.
